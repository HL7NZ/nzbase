This extension allows the use of other values for the ContactPoint.system element.

As the FHIR specification has a [required](http://hl7.org/fhir/terminologies.html#required) binding for this element, it is necessary to
provide a value from the defined set (eg 'other') then place the extension on that value.

**Example of extension**
