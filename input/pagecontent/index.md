# New Zealand base FHIR Implementation Guide

This is the base Implementation Guide (IG) for New Zealand and contains the common extensions that most NZ FHIR Implementations will need, and which other IGs (such as the NHI, HPI and Northern region guides) expand upon.


# Must Support

Many of the elements in profiles are marked as 'Must Support'. This means that clients using these profiles must underrstand what the elemenst mean, and have a startegy for dealing them - such as storing them in local repositories or displaying them to the user. They should not be ignored if present.

Note that 'Must Support' does not mean tthe same as 'Required', as they may be absent.

# Tabs in the guide

* Extensions - lists all extensions, with links to details
* Artifact Index - All the main artifacts (Resources) defined by the guide
* Support - Links to the main FHIR spec and downloads

# Download locally

There is a zipped copy of the IG which can be directly downloaded from the Support tab. This will contain all the FHIR artifacts in the guide, as well as the textual contents.
