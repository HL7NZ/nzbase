# New Zealand base FHIR Implementation Guide

This is the base Implementation Guide (IG) for New Zealand and contains the common extensions that most NZ FHIR Implementations will need.

<!--
# Must Support

Many of the elements in profiles are marked as 'Must Support'. This means that clients using these profiles must understand what the elements mean, and have a strategy for dealing them - such as storing them in local repositories or displaying them to the user. They should not be ignored if present.

Note that 'Must Support' does not mean the same as 'Required', as they may be absent.

# Tabs in the guide

* Extensions - lists all extensions, with links to details
* Artifact Index - All the main artifacts (Resources) defined by the guide
