# issue

Thius is teh folder where I inadvertently included the publish folder in the git. The publish folder has the v1 IG 

# NZBase

This is the base Implementation Guide (IG) for New Zealand and contains the most common extensions that most NZ FHIR Implementations will need.



# Download locally

There is a zipped copy of the IG which can be directly downloaded from the Support tab in the on-line IG.

# Build notes

(These are intended only for those building the guide locally, and assume that all the dependencies have been installed.)

* todo: copy generation scripts for profiles, extensions & terminologies
